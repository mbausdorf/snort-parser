# snort-parser

Takes snort rule files (*.rules) and parses them to a more readable json format using zfanta's **snort-rule-parser** package [https://www.npmjs.com/package/snort-rule-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snort-rule-parser)

Start the app with the folder containing the rules as the first, and the folder for the resulting json files as the second argument, and you are good to go.
